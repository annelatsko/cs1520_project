# cs1520_project
Repository for main project for CS 1520

##A note about Pepe the Hypoallergenic Therapy Dog:
Created by Natalie Boehm, Annie Latsko, and Hannah Tarzian for SteelHacks 2017.

If you click on it relatively rapidly, it will wag its tail.

If you click on it after you haven't clicked on it for awhile, it will get sad.

If you click on it after you haven't clicked on it for a super long time, it will die, but reclicking rapidly will bring it back to life.

This project won a minor award. We're not sure what we won yet, so basically we won Schrodinger's Beats Headphones.

### Update on the project award:

We finally got the award that we were promised, however it was super lame (like a pair of Domain.com branded fake glasses? I have real glasses and expired contacts). I hid stuff from my boyfriend and told him that it was a pair of Beats headphones that were stolen from the mail.
