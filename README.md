Repository for main project for CS 1520

##A note about Pepe the Hypoallergenic Therapy Dog:
Created by Natalie Boehm, Annie Latsko, and Hannah Tarzian for SteelHacks 2017.

If you click on it relatively rapidly, it will wag its tail.

If you click on it after you haven't clicked on it for awhile, it will get sad.

If you click on it after you haven't clicked on it for a super long time, it will die, but reclicking rapidly will bring it back to life.

This project won a minor award. We're not sure what we won yet, so basically we won Schrodinger's Beats Headphones.
